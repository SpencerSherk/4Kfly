#4K fly
Check out the NetworkSolo scene (default at the moment) for a fun networked flying bee game. I dropped this in to start getting the hang of networking in unity, which I will need to control the 3D display parameters once it goes full screeen (sliders not nicely visible).
Magic Leap, this would be a nice spin-off from my proposed project, the Vision Assistant.

4K fly generates a few thousand different views of a scene, organized and played back on a hex grid intended to play behind a hexagonal lens array, creating a 3D (NO GLASSES!) display.
